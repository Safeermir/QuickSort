Which of the following sorting algorithms is used along quicksort to sort the sub arrays?
(a) Merge Sort
(b) Selection Sort
(c) Insertion Sort
(d) Bubble Sort

Ans is Insertation sort as insertation sort algorithm is efficient for small datasets like subarrays

How many subarrays does the partitioning step of the quick sort algorithm divide the entire
array into?
(a) one
(b) two
(c) depends on the elements of the array
(d) depends on the size of the array

Ans is c part  depends on the elements of the array as we are choosing the pivot and then greater than pivot is pushed to right of the pivot 
and smaller than pivot is pushed to left of the pivot in some case pivot is last element or in some case pivot is first element at that two stages
the subarray is only one (ya right ma ya left ma ) isliya ya depend krta ha elements pa
